# Air Quality Report Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a **Power BI dashboard** that visualizes air quality data across various cities. It provides insights into key pollutants, trends over time, and geographical distribution of air quality indices.

## Features
- **Summary Metrics**: Displays the average levels of key pollutants (CO, NO, SO2, NO2).
- **Top Polluted Cities**: Highlights the three most polluted cities with their respective AQI values.
- **Least Polluted Cities**: Identifies the three least polluted cities based on AQI.
- **AQI Trend Overview**: Shows the air quality trends over the years.
- **Geographical AQI Distribution**: A map visualization depicting AQI variations across different locations.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization.
- **Excel/CSV**: As the data source.
- **GIS Mapping (Bing Maps)**: For spatial visualization.

## How to Use
1. **Download the Power BI File**: Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. **Load Your Data**: Ensure your dataset follows the required format.
3. **Customize the Dashboard**: Modify visuals as needed to fit specific analysis goals.
4. **Publish to Power BI Service**: Share insights online with stakeholders.
